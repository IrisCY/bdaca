4. Write a regular expression to identify all URLs in a string.

5. Write a regular expression that you can use to count references to Geert Wilders (make sensible choices regarding first and/or last name) or his PVV (which stands for Partij voor de Vrijheid). Make sure to minimize false positives (counting someone else with the name Geert) while also minimizing false negatives (missing a reference because of a different spelling).
